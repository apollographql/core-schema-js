- _Nothing to see here. Stay tuned._

## v0.2.1

- Add support for graphql@16 [PR #19](https://github.com/apollographql/core-schema-js/pull/19)

## v0.2.0

- __BREAKING__: Update graphql dev and peerDependency and fix `GraphQLError` usage. Update name assignment and remove name getter method [#20](https://github.com/apollographql/core-schema-js/pull/20)

## v0.1.1

- Remove unnecessary `engines` specification for `npm` which limited it to only working on `npm@7`.  The spirit of that specificity was to provide a hint to _maintainers_ as to what version of `npm` should be used to generate the `package-lock.json` file and reduce churn on that file which happened between npm@6 and npm@7.  Of course, while this was effective and harmless in the `federation` monorepo (from which this was copied and pasted from), it obviously has implications on consumers in published packages.  Fixed via [`ee1a330e`](https://github.com/apollographql/core-schema-js/commit/ee1a330e2f2c3f8b45a4526caf3bf4b3a4de4f7a).

## v0.1.0
